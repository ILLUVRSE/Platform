  <description>Small-time gambler Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford), hired to manage Ballin Mundson's casino in Buenos Aires, is startled to learn that Mundson's new wife (Rita Hayworth) is a woman he once knew, with whom he has a love-hate relationship. Things between them become complicated when Mundson (George Macready) is apparently killed, and Gilda inherits his estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;directed by Charles Vidor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rita Hayworth as Gilda Mundson&lt;br /&gt;Glenn Ford as Johnny Farrell&lt;br /&gt;George Macready as Ballin Mundson&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Calleia as Det. Maurice Obregon&lt;br /&gt;Steven Geray as Uncle Pio&lt;br /&gt;Joe Sawyer as Casey&lt;br /&gt;Gerald Mohr as Capt. Delgado&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>
